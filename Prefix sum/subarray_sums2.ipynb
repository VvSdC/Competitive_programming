    "### WHY THIS TECHNIQUE MIGHT BE FASTER IN THE CONTEXT OF COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING\n",

    "\n",
    "The hash_wrapper function doesn't define a better hash algorithm in theoretical sense, but it leverages randomized input transformation to ensure that the  inputs that trigger worst-case scenarios in python dictionary implementation are bypassed with this method by not causing many collisions."
